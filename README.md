A clean, responsive, and interactive personal portfolio page built with HTML, Tailwind CSS, and Vue.js. This project serves as a showcase for my skills and projects, providing a professional online presence.

## Features

*   **Customizable:** Easily update content and styling to match your personal brand.

## Technologies Used

*   **HTML5:** For the basic structure and semantic content.
*   **Tailwind CSS:** A utility-first CSS framework for rapid and responsive styling.
*   **Vue.js (v2.x):** A progressive JavaScript framework for building user interfaces and managing component-like behavior.

## Project Structure

The project is a single-file application, making it extremely easy to deploy and manage.

*   `index.html`: The main HTML file containing all the structure, styles (via CDN), and Vue.js application logic.
*   `profile.jpg`: (Assumed) Your profile picture for the hero/about section.
*   `skill-html.png`, `skill-css.png`, `skill-js.png`, etc.: (Assumed) Icons representing different skills.
*   `project1.jpg`, `project2.jpg`, `project3.jpg`: (Assumed) Images showcasing your projects.

## Setup and Installation

This project is designed as a single HTML file for maximum simplicity.

1.  **Download:** Download the `index.html` file and the `portfolio-assets.zip` content.
2.  **Extract Assets:** Ensure that the images mentioned in `index.html` (e.g., `profile.jpg`, `project1.jpg`, `skill-html.png`) are extracted from `portfolio-assets.zip` and placed in the **same directory** as `index.html`.
3.  **Open in Browser:** Simply open `index.html` in your web browser.

No complex build steps or server configurations are required!

## Usage

*   **Update Content:** Modify the `portfolio` data object within the `<script>` tag in `index.html` to customize your name, tagline, about description, skills, projects, and contact details.
*   **Replace Images:** Ensure you replace the placeholder images (`profile.jpg`, `project1.jpg`, etc.) with your actual images, maintaining the same filenames as referenced in the `index.html` file, or update the filenames in the Vue data.
*   **Customize Styling:** Adjust Tailwind CSS classes directly in the HTML or add custom CSS within the `<style>` tags to fine-tune the appearance.
